- **🧭 Compass Dashboard**: A streamlined results view for product owners to prioritize what users actually need.
- **⚡ Real-Time Usage Tracking**: Integrated usage dashboard with dynamic progress bars and credits management.
- **💳 Tiered Quota Enforcement**: Production-ready **Stripe** integration enforcing 3 tiers (Demo, Pro, Team) with hard API limits.

## 🤖 AI Intelligence Layer (The Compass)

ProductLogik is built with a sophisticated, self-healing AI architecture designed for reliability and strategic depth:

### 🔄 Multi-Model Fallback System (Self-Healing)
The platform prioritizes speed and cost with **Gemini 2.0 Flash**, but the `AIService` automatically detects provider failures or rate limits and fails over to **GPT-4o-mini** in real-time.

### 🎯 Strategic Theme Discovery
Our proprietary prompt architecture uses a **Senior Agile Coach persona**. It doesn't just summarize feedback; it filters noise and identifies underlying strategic risks such as "Login Friction" or "Innovation Debt".

### 🛡️ Privacy-First AI
*   **Zero-Training**: We use enterprise-grade APIs where your data is NOT used to train the base models.
*   **Minimal Footprint**: Analysis insights are stored in structured JSON; raw text is processed and evicted to respect data privacy.
